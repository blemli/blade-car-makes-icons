## Updating

Please refer to [`the upgrade guide`](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons/blob/1.x/UPGRADE.md) when updating the library.

## Blade Icons

Blade Car Makes Icons uses Blade Icons under the hood. Please refer to [the Blade Icons readme](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) for additional functionality. We also recommend to [enable icon caching](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#caching) with this library.

## Configuration

Blade Car Makes Icons also offers the ability to use features from Blade Icons like default classes, default attributes, etc. If you'd like to configure these, publish the `blade-car-makes-icons.php` config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-car-makes-icons-config
```

## Usage

Icons can be used as self-closing Blade components which will be compiled to SVG icons:

```blade
<x-car-makes-icon-acura/>
```

You can also pass classes to your icon components:

```blade
<x-car-makes-icon-acura class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500"/>
```

And even use inline styles:

```blade
<x-car-makes-icon-acura style="color: #555"/>
```

### Raw SVG Icons

If you want to use the raw SVG icons as assets, you can publish them using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-car-makes-icons --force
```

Then use them in your views like:

```blade
<img src="{{ asset('vendor/blade-car-makes-icons/o-acura.svg') }}" width="10" height="10"/>
```
